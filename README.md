This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), serves as a portfolio site where you can learn about me, what I do and how to reach me. It is a first personal foray into the framework for me but one that I am proud of and contains many excellent features I've come up with in order to sharpen my look as much as possible, such as the skills carousel, projects filtering, contact route, and general sleek modern design. To view it, press the attached link under About in the project or on some of my other social media platforms. Please enjoy.
